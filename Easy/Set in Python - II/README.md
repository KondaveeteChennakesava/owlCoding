You are familiar with working on the set in Python. Now, let's move on to work on two sets using some inbuilt functions which are used widely. They are:<br>
<strong>union</strong>(): Used to find union() between two sets. It performs this using '|' operator.<br>
<strong>intersection</strong>(): Used to find intersection() between two sets. It performs this using '&amp;' operator.<br>
<strong>difference</strong>(): Difference of A and B (A - B) is a set of elements that are only in A but not in B. Similarly for B - A holds the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Now, Given some elements in two sets <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the task is to find the elements common in two sets, elements in both the sets, elements that are only in set <strong>a</strong>, not in <strong>b</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong></span>
<span style="font-size:18px">a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</span>
<span style="font-size:18px">b = {6, 7, 8, 2, 3}</span>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Output:</strong></span>
<span style="font-size:18px">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</span>
<span style="font-size:18px">2 3</span>
<span style="font-size:18px">1 4 5</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
Your task is to complete the function <strong>all_in_set()</strong>, <strong>common_in_set()</strong> and <strong>diff()</strong> to perform union, intersection and difference between two sets&nbsp;and&nbsp;print the elements in the set after each operation.</span></p>
